# gdoc-daily-report
> A Google Apps Script that generates a daily report

## Background
During my internship at the Northwestern IT Media & Design Software Development team, my supervisor had me create a daily report every day that
detailed the work I did and outstanding issues that were in my way. I created this script to automate this process - it is customized to fit my needs,
but can easily be adapted to fit other uses as well.

## Current Features
* Moves old report to another folder and creates new report with title based on the date
* Creates reports conditionally based on the day of the week (currently does not make reports for Saturday/Sundays, non-workdays)

## To-do
* Edit the text within the document to adjust based on the date as well
