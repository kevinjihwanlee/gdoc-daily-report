# gdoc-daily-report

TODO
* Figure out how to import/export to clean up code (put constants in a different file)
* Actually use types to take advantage of TypeScript
* Edit the text to adjust based on the date as well
* Prepend 0s to single digit days
* Conditionally create reports in the code based on whether or not it is a weekday or not (is this built in the Date library?)
